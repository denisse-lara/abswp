## Projects and Practices from Automate Boring Stuff with Python

This repository contains all the projects and the practices I have completed so far from the book [Automate Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/), by Al Sweigart.

Some of the projects/practices require external dependencies, so I provided a requirements.txt file with the full list.
